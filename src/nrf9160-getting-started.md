There are some important things about the nRF9160 Feather before you get started:

1. If you haven't you can get a nRF9160 Feather [at our store](https://www.circuitdojo.com/products/nrf9160-feather) or directly from [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/circuit-dojo/PASSY-NRF9160-FEATHER/13668137)!
1. The nRF9160 Feather shouldn't be used with a battery less than 300mAH. More information in the [specs section.](./nrf9160-specs.md)
1. If you need to debug your nRF9160 Feather, it requires an external programmer. More information on that in the [Requirements for external programming](nrf9160-programming-and-debugging.md#requirements-for-external-programming) section.
1. If you're new to Zephyr, be sure to check out the [Zephyr 101 series on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJKv3qSDEE-lYuq5hMpJ_sSHQcuhO1S-P)!
