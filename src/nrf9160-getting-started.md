## Getting to know the hardware

### Soldering headers

### Connecting antennas

Once your headers are started you should *always* connect the LTE antenna before doing anything else.

Use finger to push on to the connector. You should get a nice *click*.
Removal, use your fingernail underneath and remove.

**Note** GPS isn't required before powering up but you will need it for GPS to work!

### Plugging in USB

### Connecting battery

### Using with Doubler/Tripler

### Using with Breadboard

### Sim usage

Insert into the bottom. Nano (4FF) size only.

Removal is the reverse of the above.

- Opening the SLAB_USBtoUART port on OSX. It will show up differently on PC.

## Programming Firmware

### Using J-Link

- Using tag connect. Link to example `blinky` firmware.
- nRF53 development board works best for programming
  - talk about shorting the jumper for permanent programming mode
  - using JTAG adapter board
- nrfjprog
