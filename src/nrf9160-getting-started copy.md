### Mac

### Windows

### Linux

## Programming code via bootloader

`mcumgr`
`nrfjprog`?

Speed is currently set to 115200 but hopefully that can be improved in the future!

## Programming code via nRF Connect Desktop

?

## Onboard USB-to-Serial

- Opening the SLAB_USBtoUART port on OSX. It will show up differently on PC.

## Programming Firmware

### Using J-Link

- Using tag connect. Link to example `blinky` firmware.
- nRF53 development board works best for programming
  - talk about shorting the jumper for permanent programming mode
  - using JTAG adapter board
- nrfjprog

### Using `pyocd` and CMCSIS-DAP

- ?
