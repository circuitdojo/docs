## Bootloader use

Currently the nRF9160 Feather uses the MCUBoot bootloader which comes standard
with the nRF Connect SDK. It is the recommended way to load new firmware onto
your nRF9160 Feather.

### Using `newtmgr`

**Note:** v5 of the nRF9160 Feather no longer requires manual usage of the
Mode + Reset pins. It's placed into bootloader mode automatically using the
`zephyr-tools` CLI.

`newtmgr` comes with the VSCode extension. To learn more about configuring it
see the setup page for your respective operating system:

- [Mac OS](nrf9160-sdk-setup-mac.md)
- [Windows](nrf9160-sdk-setup-windows.md)
- [Linux](nrf9160-sdk-setup-linux.md)

**Pre-check:** MCUBoot _needs_ to be enabled in your project before you can use
it! Make sure that you have `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y` in your `prj.conf`

1. Put your nRF9160 Feather into DFU mode.

   1. Hold the MODE button
   2. Then tap the RST button while holding mode
   3. **Hold the MODE button until the Blue LED illuminates**

   **V5 and newer note:** you can now get the nRF9160 Feather into bootloader
   mode by running `zephyr-tools -b` inside VSCode.

2. Building your application if you haven't already with `west build`. It will
   create a folder called `build`. The file we care about is
   `build/zephyr/app_update.bin`
3. Load the file using the **Zephyr Tools: Load via Bootloader** task. Here's
   what it's doing behind the scenes:
   <script id="asciicast-352227" src="https://asciinema.org/a/352227.js" async  data-rows="10"></script>

**Note:**

1. The transfer process is limited to 1M BAUD. In most cases it takes <15
   seconds to transfer application code.
2. The nRF9160 Feather does not respond to `newtmgr` commands **unless it's in
   DFU mode**. (See step 1 above to get it into DFU mode.)
3. If you're having trouble completing a transfer you can also add these
   parameters to the end:

```
-r 3 -t .1
```

## Requirements for external programming and debugging

You can also use external programmers with the nRF9160 Feather. Here are some external programmers in preferred order:

1. [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html) ($12 USD)
1. [nRF5340-DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Kits/nRF5340-DK) ($49 USD)
1. [nRF9160-DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Kits/nRF9160-DK)($155 USD)

**ðŸš¨Important:** the nRF52 and nRF51 based development kits **do not work** with
the nRF9160 Feather!

ðŸ‘‰Additionally, you'll also need a Tag-Connect cable. The nRF9160 Feather was
designed to use the TC2030-CTX-NL. For more information check out
[Tag-Connect's product page.](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-ctx-nl-6-pin-no-legs-cable-with-10-pin-micro-connector-for-cortex-processors)

ðŸ‘‰ Raspberry Pi Debug Probe requires an [adapter board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2743) to connect to the Tag Connect cable.

## Installing programmer software

In this next section, I'll be focusing on using the nRF5340-DK as _the_
programmer of choice. These steps should not be different from other J-Link
supported boards.

1. Download your version of the
   [nRF Command Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs)

### Windows

2. Then, run the `.exe` that was downloaded. It will do all the heavy lifting
   for you.
3. Run `nrfjprog` in a `cmd` window to make sure your install is working.
4. You may also have to add `JLink.exe` to your path. It's the exact
   [same proceedure](nrf9160-sdk-setup-windows.md#newtmgr) as adding `newtmgr`
   except the path you're adding is `C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGGER\JLink`
   ![Paths updated for Windows for JLink](/img/programming-and-debugging/paths-updated-for-jlink.png)
5. Close/restart VSCode and your Command Prompt
6. Run `jlink.exe` and make sure it opens.

   ```
   > jlink.exe
   SEGGER J-Link Commander V6.86f (Compiled Oct 23 2020 18:01:48)

   ```

### Mac

2. First run `nRF-Command-Line-Tools_10_9_0_OSX.pkg`
3. Once that install is done, run `JLink_MacOSX_V680a.pkg`
4. Open a fresh terminal window and run `nrfjprog` and `jlinkexe` to make sure
   your install is complete.

## Setting up the nRF5340-DK

Here are a couple of close up shots of how to connect the nRF5340-DK:

![nrf53-dk-connected](/img/nrf53-dk-connected.jpg)

![nRF9160 Feather w/ USB](/img/nrf9160-feather.jpg)

![nRF9160 Feather w/ Tag Connect](/img/nrf9160-feather-tag-connect.jpg)

![nRF9160 Feather w/ Tag Connect Connected](/img/nrf9160-feather-tag-connect-connected.jpg)

I highly recommend you jump _SB47_ on your nRF5340-DK with some solder. This
forces the debugger to think an external devices is permanently connected. If
you're only doing external debugging, this is very useful.

![nRF5340-DK jumper highlighted](/img/nrf53-dk-jumper.jpeg)

After hooking things up, It's time to do a quick smoke test. Running
`nrfjprog -r` in a terminal should show this result:

```jsx
$ nrfjprog -r
Applying system reset.
Run.
```

Success!

**Note:** these pictures are with an early version of the nRF9160 Feather. The
procedure is the same. The orientation of the Tag-Connect though is horizontal
not vertical as seen in the pictures.

## Securing the Bootloader

In order to deliver secure over the air updates we need to generate our own
signing key. Here's the (simplified) process:

- Change directories toÂ **_/opt/nordic/ncs/v1.x.x/bootloader/mcuboot_**
- Run the image generation script:

```
scripts/imgtool.py keygen -k your-key-rsa-2048.pem -t rsa-2048
```

- Create aÂ **mcuboot.conf**Â file in your app with the included contents:

```
CONFIG_BOOT_SIGNATURE_TYPE_RSA=y
CONFIG_BOOT_SIGNATURE_KEY_FILE="your-key-rsa-2048.pem"
```

- InÂ **CMakeLists.txt**Â add the following lines:

```
# MCUboot related
list(APPEND mcuboot_OVERLAY_CONFIG
  "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/mcuboot.conf"
  )
```

Then start a pristine build usingÂ **west:**

```
west build -b circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160_ns -p
```

A pristine buildÂ  should happen before releasing that way the version data is up
to date in the app_update.binIt's critical not to
loseÂ **your-key-rsa-2048.pem**Â as it's the key for (secure) OTA updates to
succeed.

## Programming with the nRF5340-DK

Programming with the nRF5340-DK is straight forward in Zephyr using `west`.
Here's what it looks like:

```bash
west build -b circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160_ns -p
west flash --runner nrfjprog
nrfjprog -r
```

In the above, i'm:

1. Doing a pristine build of my application with the nRF9160 Feather as the
   target.
1. Then flashing using the `nrfjprog` runner option. This is preferred for all
   J-Link boards.
1. Resetting the board using `nrfjprog -r`. As of this writing, `west` does not
   reset the board after programming.

## Getting a modem trace

Sometimes, you may be requested to get a modem trace of your device. This
section will focus on helping you get one for your nRF9160 Feather.

In order to get a modem trace, the TX and RX pins on your board need to be free.
You'll also need a UART to USB adapter of some type. I used an FTDI one that has
each of the lines broken out.

1. First, set yourÂ `prj.conf`Â to include the following lines:

   ```
   # Trace
   CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE=y
   ```

   Note: older versions of NCS use a different value. Ex:
   `CONFIG_NRF_MODEM_LIB_TRACE_ENABLED=y`

   These lines are optional:

   ```
   # AT host library
   CONFIG_UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN=y
   CONFIG_AT_HOST_LIBRARY=y
   ```

1. Then, create a folder in your project/sample calledÂ `boards`Â and add a new
   file calledÂ `circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160_ns.overlay`Â We'll want to enable the
   UART1 interface on pins 23 and 24 like below:

   ```
   / {
       chosen {
           nordic,modem-trace-uart = &uart1;
       };
   };

   &i2c1 {
       status = "disabled";
   };

   &uart1 {
       current-speed = <1000000>;
       pinctrl-0 = <&uart1_alt>;
       pinctrl-1 = <&uart1_sleep_alt>;
       pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
   };

   &pinctrl {
       uart1_alt: uart1_alt {
           group1 {
               psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_TX, 0, 24)>,
                   <NRF_PSEL(UART_RX, 0, 23)>;
           };
       };

       uart1_sleep_alt: uart1_sleep_alt {
           group1 {
               psels = <NRF_PSEL(UART_TX, 0, 24)>,
                   <NRF_PSEL(UART_RX, 0, 23)>;
               low-power-enable;
           };
       };
   };
   ```

   **Important:** UART1 is required for a modem trace and it's configured by the
   library. You shouldn't have anything using this peripheral. I2C1 must be
   disabled.

1. Connect your USB to UART adatper. I've used clips from my logic analyzer to
   hold the wires in place. Connect the **yellow** wire to the TX on the board.
   Connect the **orange** wire to the RX on the board.

   ![Wiring diagram](/img/programming-and-debugging/Screen_Shot_2020-09-16_at_4.42.58_PM.png)

   ![Probes connected](/img/programming-and-debugging/25C83B8C-FBA0-4C2B-B2A7-9CFD2C642EF1.jpeg)

1. Then open the serial port in the modem trace App and click start.

   ![Open port](/img/programming-and-debugging/cellular-monitor-select-port.png)

1. Then run your app as normal. You should see the **Trace size** go up little
   by little as connections are made, etc.

1. You can capture without opening in Wireshark or you can open Wireshark and
   monitor in real time (recomended). You will only see activity during
   network/modem activity.

   ![Wireshark](/img/programming-and-debugging/wireshark.png)

   [original article](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/nordic/cellular-iot-guides/b/getting-started-cellular/posts/how-to-get-modem-trace-using-trace-collector-in-nrf-connect)
   on the subject.

## Debugging in Visual Code

Debugging your application is possible with Visual Code. You will need a J-Link
programmer and a Tag Connect
([TC2030-CTX-NL](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-ctx-nl-6-pin-no-legs-cable-with-10-pin-micro-connector-for-cortex-processors))
cable for this process.
[Programmers include the nRF9160 DK, nRF532 DK, J-Link EDU](#requirements-for-external-programming)
(if your project is non-profit) and the standard commercial J-Link programmers.

Here's the process:

1. Download and install your version of the
   [nRF Command Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs)
1. Install the **C/C++ Extension** and the **Cortex-Debug** extensions. They're
   both very handy in development and debugging of Zephyr based projects.
   ![C/C++ Extension](/img/programming-and-debugging/c_extention.png)
   ![Cortex M Debug Extension](iimg/../img/programming-and-debugging/cortex_m_debug_extension.png)
1. If you don't have one already, create a `.vscode` folder in the **root** of
   your project.
   ![.vscode Fodler](/img/programming-and-debugging/vscode_folder.png)
1. Create a file called `launch.json`. This is where we'll set up the
   configuration for debugging.
1. Here's a real example of a config I was using to debug a project in OSX:

   ```
   {
     // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
     // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
     // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "name": "Cortex Debug",
         "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
         "executable": "${workspaceRoot}/pyrinas/applications/application/build/zephyr/zephyr.elf",
         "request": "launch",
         "type": "cortex-debug",
         "servertype": "jlink",
         "device": "nrf9160_xxAA",
         "interface": "swd",
         "armToolchainPath": "/Users/jaredwolff/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major/bin"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   For folks on Windows you'll have to modify appropriately:

   ```
   {
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
       {
           "name": "Cortex Debug",
           "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
           "executable": "${workspaceRoot}\\nrf9160-feather\\samples\\blinky\\build\\zephyr\\zephyr.elf",
           "request": "launch",
           "type": "cortex-debug",
           "servertype": "jlink",
           "device": "nrf9160_xxAA",
           "interface": "swd",
           "armToolchainPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GNU Tools Arm Embedded\\9 2019-q4-major\\bin"
       }
    ]
   }
   ```

   Remember that `workspaceRoot` refers to the folder you have opened in VSCode.
   This will most likely be `C:\Users\<your username>\ncs\v1.5.0\nfed\`.
   (`/opt/nordic/ncs/v1.5.0` for Mac) You will have to modify the `"executable"`
   entry to match the path of your `zephyr.elf` file.

1. Change the **executable** path and the **armToolchainPath** to reflect your
   system. Make sure you point the **executable** option to the `.elf` file that
   gets produced during the compilation process.
1. Next, go to your projects `prj.conf` and disable the bootloader by
   **commenting out** `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y` or changing the `y` to a
   `n`. As of this writing, disabling the bootloader **is required** as it
   prevents the debugging process from occuring.
1. In `prj.conf` you'll also want to enable the `CONFIG_DEBUG` option. This
   disables compiler optimizations which makes the debug process hairy or
   impossible.
1. Finally, program your project using `west build && west flash`
1. At this point, if you've ever done any debugging in Visual Code, you should
   be able to follow the final steps to debug your application!
1. Set some breakpoints in your code by pressing the line number you want. A red
   dot will appear where the breakpoint is set.
   ![Breakpoint](/img/programming-and-debugging/breakpoint.png)
1. Start debugging by clicking the debug icon on the left. Then click the
   **play** button in the top left.
   ![Debug menu](/img/programming-and-debugging/debug_menu.png)
   ![Debug play button](/img/programming-and-debugging/debug_play_button.png)
1. You can use the popup menu on the right to control traversal through your
   code. ![Popup debug control](/img/programming-and-debugging/debug_control.png)
