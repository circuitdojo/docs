# Programming and Debugging

There are currently two ways of programming the nRF9160 Feather. You can use the built-in bootloader or use an external programmer.

- [Bootloader use](#booloader-use)
- [External programming](#requirements-for-external-programming)

## Booloader use

Currently the nRF9160 Feather uses the MCUBoot bootloader which comes standard with the nRF Connect SDK. It is the recommended way to load new firmware onto your nRF9160 Feather.

In order to utilize the bootloader, you'll ned to install `newtmgr` (AKA `mcumgr`). Here's how below:

### Binary Download

Download one of the binary files below. (Install script coming soon...)

- [Windows](files/newtmgr/windows/newtmgr.exe)
- [Mac OSX](files/newtmgr/darwin/newtmgr)
- [Linux](files/newtmgr/linux/newtmgr)

Then place that file in your `$PATH`. On Linux and OSX that location will be `/usr/local/bin`. On Windows you can place the file in a location of your choice. Then, you'll have to update your `$PATH`. If you're unfamailiar with the process check out [this guide.](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/)

### Setting your connection configuration (one time only)

In order to easily work with `newtmgr` you'll need to make a one-time connection profile.

<script id="asciicast-352234" src="https://asciinema.org/a/352234.js" async data-rows="10"></script>

**For Mac OS**

```
newtmgr conn add serial type=serial connstring='dev=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART,baud=1000000'
```

**For Linux**

```
sudo newtmgr conn add serial type=serial connstring="dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,baud=1000000"
```

Depending on your system, the serial port may show up differently. Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the serial port name. Also, `sudo` is required for Linux to access the serial port properly.

**For Windows**

```
newtmgr conn add serial type=serial connstring="dev=COM3,baud=1000000"
```

In all three cases above you've created a connection called `serial`. We'll be using that when issuing commands to the nRF9160 Feather.

## Using `newtmgr`

</video></center>

**Pre-check:** MCUBoot *needs* to be enabled in your project before you can use it! Make sure that you have `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y` in your `prj.conf`

1. Put your nRF9160 Feather into DFU mode.
   1. Hold the MODE button
   1. Then tap the RST button while holding mode
   1. Let go of the MODE button
1. Building your application if you haven't already with `west build`. It will create a folder called `build`. The file we care about is `build/zephyr/app_update.bin`
1. Load the file using `newtmgr`
    1. Load the binary file using: `newtmgr -c serial image upload build/zephyr/app_update.bin`
    1. Reset your board using `newtmgr -c serial reset` or hit the **RST** button. Full process below:
    <script id="asciicast-352227" src="https://asciinema.org/a/352227.js" async  data-rows="10"></script>

**Note:**

1. The transfer process is limited to 1M BAUD. In most cases it takes about 8 seconds to transfer application code.
1. The nRF9160 Feather does not respond to `newtmgr` commands **unless it's in DFU mode**. (See step 1 above to get it into DFU mode.)

## Requirements for external programming

You can also use external programmers with the nRF9160 Feather. Here are the current supported external programmers:

1. [nRF5340-PDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Kits/nRF5340-PDK)
1. [nRF9160-DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Kits/nRF9160-DK)

**Note:** Most commercial J-Link programmers \*should\* work with the nRF9160 Feather. In particular the [J-Link EDU Mini](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/) is a great choice if you're building non-commercial products. (Supports Cortex M33 processors. Untested at this time.)

**ðŸš¨Important:** the nRF52 and nRF51 based development kits **do not work** with the nRF9160 Feather!

ðŸ‘‰Additionally, you'll also need a Tag-Connect cable. The nRF9160 Feather was designed to use the TC2030-CTX-NL. For more information check out [Tag-Connect's product page.](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-ctx-nl-6-pin-no-legs-cable-with-10-pin-micro-connector-for-cortex-processors)

## Installing programmer software

In this next section, I'll be focusing on using the nRF5340-PDK as *the* programmer of choice. These steps should not be different from other J-Link supported boards.

1. Download your version of the [nRF Command Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs)

### Windows

2. Then, run the `.exe` that was downloaded. It will do all the heavy lifting for you.
3. Run `nrfjprog` in a `cmd` window to make sure your install is working.

### Mac

2. First run `nRF-Command-Line-Tools_10_9_0_OSX.pkg`
3. Once that install is done, run `JLink_MacOSX_V680a.pkg`
4. Open a fresh terminal window and run `nrfjprog` to make sure your install is complete.

## Setting up the nRF5340-PDK

Here are a couple of close up shots of how to connect the nRF5340-PDK:

![nrf53-dk-connected](img/nrf53-dk-connected.jpg)

![nRF9160 Feather w/ USB](img/nrf9160-feather.jpg)

![nRF9160 Feather w/ Tag Connect Connected](img/nrf9160-feather-tag-connect-connected.jpg)

I highly recommend you jump *SB47* on your nRF5380-PDK with some solder. This forces the debugger to think an external devices is permanently connected. If you're only doing external debugging, this is very useful.

![nRF5340-DK jumper highlighted](img/nrf53-dk-jumper.jpeg)

After hooking things up, It's time to do a quick smoke test. Running `nrfjprog -r` in a terminal should show this result:

```jsx
$ nrfjprog -r
Applying system reset.
Run.
```

Success!

**Note:** these pictures are with an early version of the nRF9160 Feather. The procedure is the same. The orientation of the Tag-Connect though is horizontal not vertical as seen in the pictures.

## Programming with the nRF5340-PDK

Programming with the nRF5340-PDK is straight forward in Zephyr using `west`. Here's what it looks like:

```bash
west build -b circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns -p
west flash --runner nrfjprog
nrfjprog -r
```

In the above, i'm:

1. Doing a pristine build of my application with the nRF9160 Feather as the target.
1. Then flashing using the `nrfjprog` runner option. This is preferred for all J-Link boards.
1. Resetting the board using `nrfjprog -r`. As of this writing, `west` does not reset the board after programming.
