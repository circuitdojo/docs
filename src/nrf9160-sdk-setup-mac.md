# SDK Setup (Mac OS)

This page is all about getting your Mac compiling code for the nRF9160 Feather. Run into trouble during the process? Post your questions on the [community forum.](https://community.jaredwolff.com)

## Installing IDE
1. Install or use the code editor of your choice. I personally use Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The download link is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx)
1. If you decide to use Visual Studio Code, make sure you install the **C/C++** and **Cortex-Debug** extentions using the built in extension marketplace.

## Installing SDK
1. Install Python3. The easiest way is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Install `brew` first, then open a terminal and run:
    ```
    brew install python3 git cmake ninja wget
    ```
1. Once complete, check to make sure that `python3` is installed. Here's the example output. (Your version may be different.)
   ```
   > python3 --version
   Python 3.8.6
   ```
    **üí°Note:** if you've freshly installed Homebrew or get an error that `python3` is not found, you may have to add `/usr/local/bin` to your `PATH`. For example here's an entry for `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:
    ```
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin/:$PATH
    ```
    For a shell like `fish` you'll need:
    ```
    set -U fish_user_paths /usr/local/bin/ $fish_user_paths
    ```
1. Also check that `git` is installed with:
   ```
   ‚ùØ git --version
   git version 2.27.0
   ```
1. Install `west`. West is the most important utility for using nRF Connect SDK & Zephyr. You'll become *quite* familliar with very soon.
   ```
   pip3 install west
   ```
   **üí°Note:** you can update `west` by issuing `pip3 install -U west` It will uninstall the version on your machine and replace it with the latest. (It won't do anything if you have the latest installed.)
1. Now create a folder on your machine and call it `nfed` (short for nRF9160 Feather Examples and Drivers). Open a terminal to this folder and initialize nRF Connect SDK using `west`:
   ```
   cd ~
   mkdir nfed
   cd nfed
   west init -m https://github.com/circuitdojo/nrf9160-feather-examples-and-drivers --mr main
   ```

2. Once your nRF Connect SDK compontents are downloaded, you'll need to fetch the remaining SDK:
   ```
   west update
   ```
   You'll see a *bunch* of output go by as `west` downloads dependencies using Git.

   Here's what your `nfed` folder should look like:
   ```
   ‚ùØ tree -L 1
   .
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bootloader
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ latest
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mbedtls
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nrf
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nrf9160-feather
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nrfxlib
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zephyr
   ```
3. Install the remaining `python3` requirements by running these commands in your `nfed` directory.
   ```
   pip3 install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
   pip3 install -r nrf/scripts/requirements.txt
   pip3 install -r bootloader/mcuboot/scripts/requirements.txt
   ```

## The ARM Embedded Toolchain


1. Install the toolchain by pulling it from ARM. Run these commands:

   ```
   cd ~
   wget "https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/9-2019q4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-mac.tar.bz2"
   tar xvfj gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-mac.tar.bz2
   rm gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-mac.tar.bz2
   ```

   **Note** for Catalina users you will get an error when running these utilities for the first time. You must allow them to be executed in your Security preferences.

1. Finally you'll need export a few important environment variables for things to work. For `bash` here's the entry for `.bash_profile` that I have:
   ```
   # Zephyr related
   export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=gnuarmemb
   export GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH="~/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major"
   ```

   **üí°Note:** this should also work for `.zshrc` for those folks who are using newer versions of Mac OS (or just plain prefer `zsh`)

   For folks using `fish` you're going to use:

   ```
   set -Ux ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT gnuarmemb
   set -Ux GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH "~/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major"
   ```

## `newtmgr`

1. For loading code to your nRF9160 Feather, you'll need to download and copy a custom version of `newtmgr` to a folder in your `PATH`.

   ```
   cd ~/Downloads
   wget "https://docs.jaredwolff.com/files/newtmgr/darwin/newtmgr.zip"
   unzip newtmgr.zip
   sudo mv newtmgr /usr/local/bin
   rm newtmgr.zip
   ```

    If you're not sure, `/usr/local/bin/` is always a good spot for these types of binaries.
1. Then you'll need to add your serial profile to make it easier to download/update your device:
   ```
   newtmgr conn add serial type=serial connstring='dev=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART,baud=1000000'
   ```
   If you have multiple Silicon Labs CP2102 connected to your machine your serial port *may be named differently*. I recommend you unplug all devices that could be named `tty.SLAB_USBtoUART` to ensure you're targeting the correct device during programming.
2. **Having trouble?** You may have to [install the drivers.](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

For more info in using `newtmgr` checkout the [programming section](nrf9160-programming-and-debugging.md#booloader-use) of this documentation.

## Testing it

You can quickly test if your SDK is set up correctly by checking out the [`blinky` example](nrf9160-blinky-sample.md).
