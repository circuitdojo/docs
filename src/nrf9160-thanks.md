# Thanks üôè

Special thanks to all who have helped make this project successful. Here are a few honorable mentions:

 - Thanks to all the kind folks at **[Nordic Semiconductor][Nordic]**! From everyone on Devzone to sales and more. You've all been great!
 - Many thanks to the **[Aligni][Aligni]** team for making a great product and helping open source projects succeed.
 - Last, by not least, thanks to my main collaborators **[GroupGets][GroupGets]** and **[Hackster][Hackster]**. Without them there wouldn't be a nRF9160 Feather to release into the world!
