# Cellular Provider Matrix

![Cellular](img/cellular.png)

In order to use a provider below you'll likely have to set the PDP context. For NCS < 1.6.x, this can be done in your project's `prj.conf` in Zephyr. Here's an example of setting the PDP context to use Hologram.

```
# Set the PDP context
CONFIG_LTE_LINK_CONTROL=y
CONFIG_LTE_PDP_CMD=y
CONFIG_LTE_PDP_CONTEXT="0,\"IP\",\"hologram\""
```

Simply replace `hologram` with a provider specific APN and you'll be good to go.

Some providers also require a username and password. For example, here's what Soracom's looks like:

```
CONFIG_LTE_PDN_AUTH_CMD=y
CONFIG_LTE_PDN_AUTH="0,\"PAP\",\"sora\",\"sora\""
```

**Side note:** in the case of both Hologram an Soracom you **do not** need the PDP context to transfer data.

Here's a full working list of what plays nicely with the nRF9160 Feather. This list is subject to change at any time.

## Customer reports

We don't always have the ability to test every single cellular provider. In this section, here are a few providers that customers have reported success with.

| Provider Name | Connected To | Notes | APN |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----- | --- |
|               |              |       |     |
