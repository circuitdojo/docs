# Cellular Provider Matrix

![Cellular](img/cellular.png)

Here are some results from recent testing of the nRF9160 Feather. As of this writing, the nRF9160 Fether is not an end certified deivce. That means there is limited support for all the known networks in the USA.

**Note:** End device certification is underway with Verizon! Estimated completion is mid to late August.

In order to use a provider below you'll likely have to set the PDP context. This can be done in your project's `prj.conf` in Zephyr. Here's an example of setting the PDP context to use Hologram.

```
# Set the PDP context
CONFIG_LTE_LINK_CONTROL=y
CONFIG_LTE_PDP_CMD=y
CONFIG_LTE_PDP_CONTEXT="0,\"IP\",\"hologram\""
```

Simply replace `hologram` with a provider specific APN and you'll be good to go.

Some providers also require a username and password. For example, here's what Soracom's looks like:

```
CONFIG_LTE_PDN_AUTH_CMD=y
CONFIG_LTE_PDN_AUTH="0,\"PAP\",\"sora\",\"sora\""
```

Here's a full working list of what plays nicely with the nRF9160 Feather. This list is subject to change at any time.

before adopting a provider.

## Customer reports

We don't always have the ability to test every single cellular provider. In this section, here are a few providers that customers have reported success with.

| Provider Name | Connected To | Notes                                                                   | APN |
