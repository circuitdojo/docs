This page is all about getting your Linux machine compiling code for the nRF9160 Feather. Run into trouble during the process? Post your questions on the [community forum.](https://community.jaredwolff.com)

## Installing IDE
1. Install or use the code editor of your choice. I personally use Microsoft Visual Studio Code. You can download directly from the Ubuntu Software Install utility.

## Installing Extension

Fortunately, it's a bit easier to get started with the VSCode extension. The VSCode is required along with a Python 3 and Git on your system before continuing. 

First make sure you [download the extension here. ðŸ‘ˆ](downloads/zephyr-tools-0.1.4.vsix)

Then install Git and Python.

For example on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip
```

### Install the Extension

Open VSCode and go to the extensions tab. Use the dropdown to install .visx manually.

Once loaded it will also install all necessary VSCode dependencies.

### Run Setup

Then open the command window (COMMAND+SHIFT+P on Mac or CTRL+SHIFT+P on other systems) and type `Zephyr Tools: Setup`

![Setup](air-quality-wing/img/extension/setup.png)

### Init the repo

Then initialize this repo using the `Zephyr Tools: Init Repo` command:

![Init repo](air-quality-wing/img/extension/init-repo.png)

Make sure you use `https://github.com/circuitdojo/nrf9160-feather-examples-and-drivers.git` as the URL. It's best to select an **empty folder** to initialize the project to.

### Then build the sample!

![Build](air-quality-wing/img/extension/build.png)

You'll be prompted for a **project** and **board**. Make sure the board matches the supported boards. Current supported board targets include:

Here's what it will look like:

![Choosing board](air-quality-wing/img/extension/choosing-board.png)
![Choosing app](air-quality-wing/img/extension/choosing-app.png)

Once the build completes you should get a **Build complete!** popup along with some success messages in the the terminal.

## `newtmgr` (Used to load your application via USB serial bootloader)

1. For loading code via the bootloader to your nRF9160 Feather, you'll need to download and copy a custom version of `newtmgr` to a folder in your `PATH`.

   ```
   cd ~/Downloads
   wget "https://docs.jaredwolff.com/files/newtmgr/linux/newtmgr.zip"
   unzip newtmgr.zip
   mv newtmgr /usr/local/bin/
   rm newtmgr.zip
   ```
   
2. Then you'll need to add your serial profile to make it easier to download/update your device:
   ```
   newtmgr conn add serial type=serial connstring='dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,baud=1000000'
   newtmgr -c serial reset
   ```

   If you have multiple Silicon Labs CP2102 connected to your machine your serial port *may be named differently*. I recommend you unplug all devices that could be named `ttyUSB0` to ensure you're targeting the correct device during programming.

   **Note** if you get a `Error: open /dev/ttyUSB0: permission denied` error. You'll have to fix permissions for the serial device for all users. Here are the steps:

   Open this `.rules` file in `vi` (or your editor of choice)

   ```
   sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/50-myusb.rules
   ```

   Then within the editor hit **i**, paste this:

   ```
   KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*",MODE="0666"
   KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*",MODE="0666"
   ```

   Hit the **esc** button and then type `:wq!`.


For more info in using `newtmgr` checkout the [programming section](nrf9160-programming-and-debugging.md#booloader-use) of this documentation.

## Testing it

You can quickly test if your SDK is set up correctly by checking out the [samples](nrf9160-example-code.md).
